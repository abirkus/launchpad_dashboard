launchpad_dashboard

This dashboard allows us to view GitHub activity for the following frameworks and compare activity numbers side by side:

React: https://github.com/facebook/react
Angular: https://github.com/angular/angular.js
Ember: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/
Vue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue

The framework with the highest activity numbers can be assumed to be most popular. 

I used Vanilla JS to fetch activity data from Github's Developer API. 

To view the dashboard on your local machine, clone the repo and run the following commands:

    - npm i
    - npm start
    
Open your browser and paste http://localhost:8080/ to view the page.
